# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
TOKEN_ADDRESS_WBNB = "0x1f9C9126e01f2b151d7C11958c5c5d507e22bf17"
https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0x1f9C9126e01f2b151d7C11958c5c5d507e22bf17

FACETORY_ADDRESS = "0xE8C6A4b59A8B270D63d32067Ee4B07F69DaDA7AC"
https://testnet.bscscan.com/address/0xE8C6A4b59A8B270D63d32067Ee4B07F69DaDA7AC

ROUTER_ADDRESS = "0xf2914eDB791D294C6bcA7a940C6667dD097347C8"
